# Neogem

Neogem is a 2.5D (isometric) A-RPG made with C++.
I'm currently alone to develop the Ngine (read engine), which is the core of the game.
Eventually, I don't wanna make it an open-source game, and the Ngine in itself will be very rigid.
Because of this, all addition to the game will be made within its limits, using the Neogem Scripting Language or a dedicated GUI editor.

For now, these are the main parts of the Ngine that are functional :
-OpenGL wrap for displaying
-Main architecture of the game modes
Now I just have to make different game modes (exploration, menus, etc...)

The main mode being the exploration, I already have made quite a job for it, so I have different working parts :
-2.5D Physics
-2D Textures and Animations
-Events (made in the RPG Maker-style)

The first pre-release (v0.1.0) just came out with a test map containing a mini-puzzle.
0.11.0 will have a better test map, optimized code and a dialog manager, and is planned for Feb 20.


As mentioned before, it's not my goal to make it an open-source/moddable game in the future, but if you want to help this project, you can send me a mail at ginka-neogem@hotmail.com

Every help that makes the Ngine significantly progress will be rewarded.
